Fistly, this had the effect on the policy stabilization to be slower than the previous case since now our policy has to account for future rewards also and not just current ones. Secondly, after the execution of the code block below we understand that with the increase of the transaction fee the presence of our policy picking to stay for some stocks and to leave for others becomes much more probable. Lastly, we can also see that as the rewards of the stocks rise, the policy picks to stay in the current stock we get that from the logging having gaps, meaning that for high transaction costs it picks to stay at the same stock that has high reward."

For the number of stocks we have concluded that up to N = 8, the execution time in Google Colab seems to be fast, under 12 minutes. After that with each further addition of a new stock the computational time increases exponentially  surpassing 1 hour easily.
